1998-03-25   Gisle Aas <aas@sn.no>

   Release alpha-0.10

   Added LWP::Sink modules.  Plan is to use them to implement stacked
   transfer encodings and stuff like that.

   LWP::Conn::HTTP beginning to support the TE header.

   LWP::Conn::HTTP skip all 1xx responses.



1998-03-23   Gisle Aas <aas@sn.no>

   Release alpha-0.09

   More experiments with hooks, also for LWP::Requests.  New module
   LWP::Hooks which both LWP::UA and LWP::Request inherit from.
   Both redirect and authentication handled by hooks.
   
   Renamed $server->status to $server->c_status.
   
   Implemented $ua->cookie_jar



1998-03-19   Gisle Aas <aas@sn.no>

   Release alpha-0.08

   Updated documentation ('News')

   LWP::Request::clone also copies flags now

   Renamed LWP::Request::done() to LWP::Request::response_done()

   LWP::Server maintains 'created', 'request_count', 'last_request_time'
   attributes.

   LWP::Conn::FILE support the ETag header and corresponding If-headers.

   LWP::Conn::HTTP did not stop after the first successful connect to
   a multihomed site.

   LWP::Conn::HTTP would not honor the protocol version if specified in
   the LWP::Request.  We also add a 'Connection: close' header for the
   last request sent on a connection.

   Allow LWP::Request response_data() to die in order to signal that the
   connection should be broken.



1998-03-18   Gisle Aas <aas@sn.no>

   Release alpha-0.07

   Introduced LWP::StdSched, LWP::Request, URI::Attr classes.

   Implement file:/... access.  (LWP::Conn::FILE)

   Started to write some documentation (the 'News' file).

   Made $ua->spool more robust in case of bad request.  Ensure that
   all requests get a response_done() callback.

   Introduced 'term-ua'

   LWP::EventLoop will protect timer callbacks with eval { ... }

   Various tweaks and additions to LWP::UA/LWP::Server

   LWP::Conn::HTTP:
       - died when gethostbyname() failed
       - did not set $idle_timeout on startup in Idle mode
       - would call pushback with 0 request on error.
       - changed error code (now use 591)
       - zap requests queue if the Connect state result in error
       - callbacks to Mgr when going active/idle
       - introduce Closed state
