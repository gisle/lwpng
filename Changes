   Implement file:/... access.  (LWP::Conn::FILE)

   LWP::EventLoop will protect timer callbacks with eval { ... }

   Various tweaks and additions to LWP::UA/LWP::Server

   LWP::Conn::HTTP:
       - died when gethostbyname() failed
       - did not set $idle_timeout on startup in Idle mode
       - would call pushback with 0 request on error.
       - changed error code (now use 591)
       - zap requests queue if the Connect state result in error
       - callbacks to Mgr when going active/idle
