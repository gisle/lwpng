   Release alpha-0.16

   Getting rid of some unconditional debug printouts.

   LWP::EventLoop->one_event and LWP::EventLoop->run now both take
   an optional timeout argument.

   Added some documentation to a few modules: LWP::EventLoop, LWP::MainLoop,
   LWP::Sink, URI::Attr, LWP::Conn

   Release alpha-0.15

   LWP::Conn::HTTP: If a request have a Connection: header with the
   "close" token, then always make it the last request on this
   connection.

   LWP::Conn::HTTP: If the server sends a "Connection: close" header
   then inhibit further pipelining.

   Automatically retry non-first request on a connection if the server
   closes the connection without sending any response.

   Improved the scheduler.  It could previously create too many
   connections.  It now also tries to activate existing connections
   if we have queued requests.

   LWP::Conn::HTTP: will emulate IO::Handle->blocking if you use
   older versions of the IO modules and you have working fcntl().
   This means that we now always use non-blocking sockets.



1998-04-06   Gisle Aas <aas@sn.no>

   Release alpha-0.14

   Added LWP::Authen::digest, but it still needs some tweaking.

   LWP::Conn::HTTP now supports dynamic request content, which is
   triggered by letting the request->content() be a CODE reference.

   LWP::Conn::HTTP now supports '101 Swithing protocol' responses.
   The socket connection is returned as an (unofficial) attribute
   of the HTTP::Response object.

   Updated the 'News' file some.



1998-04-01   Gisle Aas <aas@sn.no>

   Release alpha-0.13

   Moved redirect handling and authentication handling to separate
   modules:  LWP::Redirect and LWP::Authen

   New interface for specific authentication handlers.  Renamed
   LWP::Authen::BASIC to LWP::Authen::basic.

   Automatic setup of Authorization and Proxy-Authorization headers
   based on earlier logins after 401/407 responses.

   Set Date header in requests that have content.

   term-ua can ask for login information now.  It prints a prompt.
   Command to evaluate perl code.  Help command.

   A response handler can now abort processing of other response
   handlers by returning the string "ABORT".

   The "request" hook in the LWP::UA has been renamed "spool_request"
   and we have inverted the value returned to signal that the request
   has been handeled.

   More compact dumping of the URI::Attr object state.

   LWP::Conn::HTTP now make sure that $req->response_done() is called
   as the last thing in the event handler routine.  This allows it to
   not return immediately, for instance because a handler ask the
   human user about how to proceed.

   The 'authd' test daemon.



1998-03-30   Gisle Aas <aas@sn.no>

   Release alpha-0.12

   Will now copy response_handler hooks when making a clone of a
   LWP::Request object.

   Handle "300 Multiple Choices" as 302 if a Location header is
   found in the response.

   LWP::Server will now automatically create a new connection if
   the last connection is closed and we still have requests to do.

   LWP::UA::setup_proxy returned wrong value when a proxy was already
   set up.

   LWP::Conn::HTTP always overwrite the request TE header now.

   LWP::Sink::_Pipe instead of LWP::Sink::_trans.  push() instead
   of append().

   LWP::Sink::identity can buffer data now.

   Implemented LWP::Sink::Buffer and LWP::Sink::qp.



1998-03-26   Gisle Aas <aas@sn.no>

   Release alpha-0.11

   Added the testd/* daemon that makes it easy to generate various
   responses in order to test HTTP client libraries.

   Support chained transfer encodings.  deflate/base64/rot13/identity.

   We had an infinite loop if a chunk header happened to be divided on
   the wire.

   LWP::Sink::identity should not close its sink if it was a CODE
   reference.



1998-03-25   Gisle Aas <aas@sn.no>

   Release alpha-0.10

   Added LWP::Sink modules.  Plan is to use them to implement stacked
   transfer encodings and stuff like that.

   LWP::Conn::HTTP beginning to support the TE header.

   LWP::Conn::HTTP skip all 1xx responses.



1998-03-23   Gisle Aas <aas@sn.no>

   Release alpha-0.09

   More experiments with hooks, also for LWP::Requests.  New module
   LWP::Hooks which both LWP::UA and LWP::Request inherit from.
   Both redirect and authentication handled by hooks.
   
   Renamed $server->status to $server->c_status.
   
   Implemented $ua->cookie_jar



1998-03-19   Gisle Aas <aas@sn.no>

   Release alpha-0.08

   Updated documentation ('News')

   LWP::Request::clone also copies flags now

   Renamed LWP::Request::done() to LWP::Request::response_done()

   LWP::Server maintains 'created', 'request_count', 'last_request_time'
   attributes.

   LWP::Conn::FILE support the ETag header and corresponding If-headers.

   LWP::Conn::HTTP did not stop after the first successful connect to
   a multihomed site.

   LWP::Conn::HTTP would not honor the protocol version if specified in
   the LWP::Request.  We also add a 'Connection: close' header for the
   last request sent on a connection.

   Allow LWP::Request response_data() to die in order to signal that the
   connection should be broken.



1998-03-18   Gisle Aas <aas@sn.no>

   Release alpha-0.07

   Introduced LWP::StdSched, LWP::Request, URI::Attr classes.

   Implement file:/... access.  (LWP::Conn::FILE)

   Started to write some documentation (the 'News' file).

   Made $ua->spool more robust in case of bad request.  Ensure that
   all requests get a response_done() callback.

   Introduced 'term-ua'

   LWP::EventLoop will protect timer callbacks with eval { ... }

   Various tweaks and additions to LWP::UA/LWP::Server

   LWP::Conn::HTTP:
       - died when gethostbyname() failed
       - did not set $idle_timeout on startup in Idle mode
       - would call pushback with 0 request on error.
       - changed error code (now use 591)
       - zap requests queue if the Connect state result in error
       - callbacks to Mgr when going active/idle
       - introduce Closed state



1998-03-13   Gisle Aas <aas@sn.no>

   Release alpha-0.04

   After a long period of ignoring it I once again started to work
   on LWP-ng.  Made the LWP::UA and LWP::Server class working again.



1997-12-11   Gisle Aas <aas@sn.no>

   Release alpha-0.03

   Minor changes since 0.01.  Some testing scripts.  Renaming
   of connection class to LWP::Conn::HTTP.



1997-11-26   Gisle Aas <aas@sn.no>

   Release alpha-0.01

   The start of this project.  Basic implementation of LWP::EventLoop
   and LWP::HConn finished.
