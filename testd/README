The program 'httpd' is the test daemon.  Once started it will write
it's location to the file './URL' and will start to serve all the
files within this directory asis.  It also makes noice on STDOUT.

Only the first segment of the path given in the URL is used to select
the file.  The query part of the URL can be used to influence how the
content is written back to the client.

   w=<n>  : how many milli-seconds to wait between each write.  The
            default is to not wait.

   cs=<n> : what chunk-size should we use when copying data from the
            file.  The default is 8k.

   line=1 : send each line separately

   cr=1   : send each line separately, and terminate header lines
            with CRLF
