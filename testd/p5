This message use a strange HTTP version number, which clients MUST be
able to parse:

  The version of an HTTP message is indicated by an HTTP-Version field in
  the first line of the message.

         HTTP-Version   = "HTTP" "/" 1*DIGIT "." 1*DIGIT

  Note that the major and minor numbers MUST be treated as separate
  integers and that each may be incremented higher than a single digit.
  Thus, HTTP/2.4 is a lower version than HTTP/2.13, which in turn is lower
  than HTTP/12.3. Leading zeros MUST be ignored by recipients and MUST NOT
  be sent.
