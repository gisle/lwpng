HTTP/1.1 301 Moved
Connection: close
Location: redir2
Content-Type: text/plain

This is a chain of redirects with these statuses:

  301 --> 302 --> 303 --> 307 -> 305

We make relative redirects, even if they are not really legal.  They
seem to be used, and I think a client should handle it.  A proper
absolute URL is hard to make as this static content does not know the
base URL of the server.
